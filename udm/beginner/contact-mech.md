Apache OFBiz uses a set of entities to manage various types of contact mechanisms:

ContactMech: The central table for storing different forms of contact information.

TelecomNumber: Specifically stores telephone numbers.

PostalAddress: Holds details of postal addresses.

EmailAddress: Used for storing email addresses. Sometimes, it's not a separate table but rather a type of contact mechanism stored in ContactMech.

PartyContactMech: Links contact mechanisms to specific parties (individuals or organizations).

ContactMechType: Defines different types of contact mechanisms, like phone, email, postal address, etc.

ContactMechPurpose: Specifies the purpose for which a contact mechanism is used (e.g., billing, shipping).

PartyContactMechPurpose: Connects a PartyContactMech to a specific purpose.

Here's a combined JSON sample data reflecting these entities:

```
{
  "ContactMech": [
    {
      "contactMechId": "10010",
      "contactMechTypeId": "TELECOM_NUMBER",
      "TelecomNumber": {
        "countryCode": "1",
        "areaCode": "123",
        "contactNumber": "4567890"
      },
      "PartyContactMechPurpose": {
        "purposeTypeId": "PRIMARY_PHONE"
      }
    },
    {
      "contactMechId": "10011",
      "contactMechTypeId": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
      "infoString": "example@email.com",
      "PartyContactMechPurpose": {
        "purposeTypeId": "PRIMARY_EMAIL"
      }
    },
    {
      "contactMechId": "10012",
      "contactMechTypeId": "POSTAL_ADDRESS",
      "PostalAddress": {
        "address1": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "postalCode": "12345",
        "countryGeoId": "USA"
      },
      "PartyContactMechPurpose": {
        "purposeTypeId": "BILLING_ADDRESS"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this JSON:

Each contact mechanism is represented as an object within the ContactMech array.
contactMechId and contactMechTypeId identify each contact mechanism.
Nested objects (TelecomNumber, infoString for email, and PostalAddress) store the contact details.
PartyContactMechPurpose with purposeTypeId specifies the purpose of each contact mechanism.
This model provides a detailed view of how contact information is structured and linked to its purpose in Apache OFBiz. Remember, the actual OFBiz implementation might have more fields and relationships, and the JSON representation is a simplified version for illustrative purposes.
