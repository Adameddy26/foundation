# Problem Statement: GitHub-Integrated Template Management for Moqui

## Current Situation

We currently use **Freemarker templates** within our **Moqui applications** to generate data outputs in desired formats. These templates are essential for integration pipelines such as the **getOrder API for NetSuite**, which transforms data into a schema that matches NetSuite's requirements. However, we face several challenges related to how these templates are managed and deployed.

---

## Challenges

### 1. Client-Specific Customization
- **NetSuite Integration**:
    - Each client's NetSuite setup varies based on factors like product definitions, organizational structures, inventory management, and fulfillment processes.
    - These variations lead to slight differences in the required data schema, necessitating frequent customization of the output format.
- The pipeline for transforming data must be flexible to accommodate these schema differences.

### 2. Dependency on Moqui Deployment
- Templates are currently managed as part of the Moqui deployment package.
- Any update to a Freemarker or JOLT template requires:
    - **Rebuilding** the Moqui deployment.
    - **Redeploying** the updated instance.
- This process introduces downtime, delays in addressing client-specific requirements, and operational inefficiencies.

### 3. Integration Workflow Complexity
- Data transformation pipelines rely on a combination of:
    - **Freemarker Templates**: For rendering data into specific formats.
    - **JOLT Specifications**: For JSON transformations.
- Managing these template files as part of the application increases operational overhead and reduces agility.

### 4. Limited Support for Runtime Updates
- Currently, it is not possible to update templates dynamically in production without deploying a new instance.
- This limitation slows down issue resolution and customization for production clients.

### 5. Existing Alternatives Evaluated
- **DbResource**: Storing templates in the database adds management complexity and requires custom solutions for audit and version control.
- **JCR Jackrabbit**: A content repository approach adds significant learning overhead, resource requirements, and infrastructure complexity.
- Both solutions are more resource-intensive than desired for our needs.

## Goal

We aim to implement a solution that:

1. **Eliminates the Need for Redeployment**:
    - Allows templates to be updated in production without requiring a redeployment of Moqui.
2. **Supports Customization and Agility**:
    - Enables flexible and reliable customization of data output and ingestion pipelines for client-specific needs.
3. **Minimizes Complexity**:
    - Avoids introducing significant overhead in terms of infrastructure, learning curves, or resource consumption.
4. **Provides Audit and Controls**:
    - Ensures templates are versioned, traceable, and securely managed.

---

## Proposed Solution

We propose using **Git as the repository for managing templates**, integrating it with the Moqui platform to:

1. Load templates dynamically from a **named branch** (e.g., `prod`) in the Git repository.
2. Enable the **Production Support Team** to:
    - Edit, test, and promote templates directly within Git workflows.
    - Use Git's native version control and collaboration features to maintain auditability and ensure control over changes.
3. Ensure the **Moqui application** always reads templates from the `prod` branch at runtime, eliminating the need for redeployment.

## Advantages of This Approach

### 1. Minimal Learning Path
- Teams already familiar with Git will find it easy to adopt this approach.
- No need to learn new tools or complex infrastructure like JCR.

### 2. Least Resource Intensive
- Leverages existing Git infrastructure, avoiding the need for additional servers or databases.

### 3. Dynamic Updates
- Templates can be updated and tested in real time, improving agility and reducing downtime.

### 4. Audit and Controls
- Gitâ€™s version control provides built-in audit logs, branch-based workflows, and traceability for template changes.

By implementing this approach, we align with the goals of making our platform agile, scalable, and easy to maintain while supporting the varied requirements of client-specific NetSuite integrations. This strategy minimizes operational inefficiencies and enhances our ability to respond to client needs promptly.
