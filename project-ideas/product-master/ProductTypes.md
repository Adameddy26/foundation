- No transfer of possession or ownership takes place when services are sold.  
- They cannot be stored or transported and come into existence at the time they are bought and consumed.

### Good
A good is a tangible physical product that can be sold to customers, contrasting with a service which is intangible.  
**Example:** An apple is a tangible good, whereas a haircut is an intangible service.
