### **rejectShipmentItem** 

**Purpose**
The primary goal of the `rejectShipmentItem` service is to handle the rejection of a specific item within a shipment. This involves updating the shipment item's status, adjusting inventory levels, and potentially canceling associated order items.

**Input Parameters**

*   **`shipmentId` (String):** The ID of the shipment containing the item to be rejected.
*   **`shipmentItemSeqId` (String):** The sequence ID of the specific item within the shipment.
*   **`quantity` (BigDecimal):** The quantity of the item being rejected. If not provided, the entire quantity of the shipment item is assumed to be rejected.
*   **`recordVariance` (String):** A flag ("Y" or "N") indicating whether to record an inventory variance for the rejected item.
*   **`rejectionReasonId` (String):** The ID of the reason for the rejection (e.g., "DAMAGED," "INCORRECT_ITEM").
*   **`rejectionComments` (String):** Additional comments about the rejection.
*   **`setAutoCancelDate` (String):** A flag ("Y" or "N") indicating whether to automatically set a cancellation date for the associated order item.
*   **`excludeOrderFacilityDuration` (Integer):** An optional parameter used in calculating the cancellation date (if `setAutoCancelDate` is "Y").
*   **`userLogin` (GenericValue):** The userLogin object representing the user performing the action.

**Use Cases**

This service is typically used when an item within a shipment is found to be unsuitable for fulfillment due to reasons like:

*   **Damage:** The item is damaged and cannot be shipped.
*   **Incorrect Item:** The wrong item was picked for the shipment.
*   **Customer Cancellation:** The customer canceled the order for that specific item.
*   **Other Reasons:** Any other reason that might necessitate rejecting an item from a shipment.

**Workflow**

1.  **Input Validation:** The service first validates the input parameters, ensuring that the `shipmentId` and `shipmentItemSeqId` are valid, and the `recordVariance` and `setAutoCancelDate` flags are either "Y" or "N."

2.  **Fetch Shipment and Order Details:** It retrieves the `Shipment` and `OrderHeader` records associated with the given `shipmentId`.

3.  **Handle Kit/Component Items:** If the rejected item is part of a kit, the service removes all associated order shipment records for the kit's components.

4.  **Reject Order Item:** The service calls the `rejectOrderItem` service (not shown in the provided code) to handle the actual rejection of the order item. This likely involves updating the order item status, adjusting inventory levels, and potentially triggering other actions.

5.  **Record Inventory Variance (Optional):** If `recordVariance` is "Y," the service records an inventory variance to track the adjustment in inventory due to the rejection.

6.  **Set Cancellation Date (Optional):** If `setAutoCancelDate` is "Y," the service calculates and sets a cancellation date for the associated order item.

**Error Handling:** The service includes error handling to catch exceptions and return appropriate error messages.
