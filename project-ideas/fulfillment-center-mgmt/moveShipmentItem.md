**Use Cases**

This service is typically used in the following scenarios:

*   **Consolidating Shipments:** If multiple shipments are going to the same address, it might be more efficient to combine items into a single shipment.
*   **Correcting Errors:** If an item was accidentally placed in the wrong shipment, this service can be used to move it to the correct one.
*   **Splitting Shipments:** If a shipment becomes too large or heavy, some items can be moved to a new shipment.

**Workflow**

1.  **Input Validation:** The service validates the input parameters to ensure they are correct and consistent. It checks for the existence of the shipments, verifies that the shipments belong to the same order, and confirms the validity of the shipment item and quantity.

2.  **Remove Item from Original Shipment:** The service calls the `deleteOrderShipmentItem` service to remove the specified quantity of the item from the original shipment.

3.  **Add Item to New Shipment:** The service calls the `createOrderShipmentItem` service to add the specified quantity of the item to the new shipment. It uses the `OrderShipment` entity to associate the item with the correct order and shipment.

**Error Handling:** The service includes error handling to catch exceptions and return appropriate error messages if any issues occur during the process.
