## Linux Work - July 6, 2024

### Memory Management

1. **Swap Memory Preparation:** Linux creates a dedicated swap partition or file during setup.

2. **Swap Memory Function:**  Acts as an overflow for RAM, storing inactive pages when RAM is full.

3. & 4. **OS Memory Management:** The OS handles allocation, deallocation, and swapping using techniques like paging.

5. **RAM and Swap Relationship:** Both are part of virtual memory, with swap extending RAM on the disk.

6. **OS Resource Allocation:** The OS assigns CPU, memory, and I/O resources to processes based on priority and availability using scheduling algorithms.

7. **JVM Memory Communication:** The JVM requests specific memory sizes (initial and maximum heap, stack) from the OS.

8. **Browser Tab Memory Usage:** Active tabs consume more memory than inactive ones, which may be put into low-memory states or unloaded.

9. **Memory in OS, JVM, and V8:**
   * **Unix:** Uses paging, swapping, and caching.
   * **JVM:** Employs garbage collection and heap management.
   * **V8 Engine:** Handles memory allocation and garbage collection for JavaScript.

10. **RAM vs. Swap Memory:**
    * **RAM:** Primary, fast, volatile.
    * **Swap:** Secondary, slower, non-volatile.

11. **Swap Configuration:**  Specified during OS installation or later, can be modified dynamically.

12. **Memory Setting Methods:**
    * **OS:** System calls like `malloc` and `free`.
    * **JVM:** Flags like `-Xms` and `-Xmx`.

13. **Swap Necessity Algorithm:**  OS uses LRU (Least Recently Used) to decide swapping when memory pressure is high.

14. **Paging and Schedulers:** Paging divides memory into fixed-size pages. Schedulers determine when to swap pages based on access patterns.

15. **EntityQuery Cache:**  Use cache for frequently accessed data, avoid it for volatile or rarely used data.

16. **OS Memory Usage (Opt-in/Opt-out):** Research memory management policies to understand trade-offs.

### V8 and JVM

19. **Memory Dump Analysis (Hangs):** Captures the current memory state to investigate leaks and resource issues.

20. **Restart and Dump:** Examine heap, stack, and allocations in the dump to find abnormalities.

21. **Memory Optimization:** Minimize resource-intensive operations in your programs.

### Process and User Management

22. **OS Process Management:** (No specific details provided)

23. **Process Experimentation:**  Test process execution, priority, and limits to understand their behavior.

24. **Unix Permissions:**  Manage users and groups, set permissions using `chmod` and `chown`.

25. **LDAP:**  Directory service for authentication and authorization, often used in networked environments. Open-source implementations exist.

26. & 27. **User Authentication:**
    * **Unix:**  Uses various mechanisms (not detailed here).
    * **Active Directory:** Centralized authentication for Windows environments.

28. **Novell Remote Connection:**  Enables desktop access to network resources with authentication.

29. & 30. **Authentication Methods:**
    * **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Uses SAML protocol.
    * **Cloud:** Various methods like OAuth, OpenID Connect.

31. **API Authentication Implementation:** (No specific details provided)

32. **Logs and Logging:** Maintain detailed logs for debugging and troubleshooting.

I hope this structured format helps you better understand the Linux topics covered!
